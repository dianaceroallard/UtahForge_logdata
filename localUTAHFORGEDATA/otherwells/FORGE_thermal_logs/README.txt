Contents
----------------------------------------

> One folder named 'raw logs' containing the raw thermal logs of the boreholes.
> One folder named 'FaT' containing the post-processed thermal data using F alpha Tau method.
> One coordinate file for well locations in WGS84

BRIEF REMARKS
---------------------------------
> 4 wells were found and logged successfully during FORGE Phase 2C: OH-3, OH-4, WOW-2, and WOW-3.
> Depth to the ground water table was measured weeks prior to logging for logistical purposes and also after completing temperature logs.
> Temperature data was logged downhole, holding at predetermined postions to allow thermal calibration of the probe. The holding time in air and water are minimum 900 seconds and 90 seconds respectively.
> Temperature logs continued to run during uphole extraction to check for probe errors as well as depth couter issues.
> F alpha Tau is a program that uses the temperature time curve to calculate the equilibrium temperature at a finite holding position in the borehole.
